            <p>I aspire to be a librarian someday, which is why I am in the MLIS program at Indiana University. 
                However, beyond that, my day-to-day life is about much more than just my goal of becoming a librarian. 
                I love music and have been playing the French horn since I was 11.
                I also regularly play with the Ltrain Brass Band here in New York City.</p>

            <p>For work, I am a Content Database Manager at BBC Studios in New York. 
                I work on our streaming service, BritBox, and have been doing so for three years. 
                I do love my job, but my goal is to one day become a public librarian or a public school librarian.</p>

            <h2>Duck Facts!</h2>
            <aside class="aside1">
                <p>Some of my favorite birds are ducks, and I am overjoyed when I find so many different breeds when walking around Central Park.<p>
                <p> Below on the <b>left</b> we have the <b>Wood Duck</b> which is known to stay year-round in NYC. Males are some of the most colorful breeds
                of ducks with their striking green, blue and purple feathers and red eyes with a white face pattern. 
                Unlike most ducks, Wood Ducks nest in tree cavities near water. 
                They sometimes use nest boxes set up by conservationists.<p>
                    
                <p> On the <b>right</b> we have the <b>Hooded Merganser</b> who visits NYC primarily in the winter season. 
                Males have a black head with a large white patch on the crest, golden-yellow eyes, and chestnut-colored sides. 
                Females are brownish with a spiky, reddish-brown crest.
                Unlike most ducks, Wood Ducks nest in tree cavities near water. 
                Hooded Mergansers are often more elusive than other ducks, preferring quiet freshwater ponds, marshes, 
                and wooded rivers, which can make them hard to spot in noisy areas in NYC.<p>

        <aside class="aside1">
            <p> Below on the <b>left</b> we have the <b>Northern Shoveler</b> who similarly visits NYC in the winter season. 
            Similar to Mallards but with a distinctive white chest and rusty sides. Females are brown and mottled. 
            They have a huge, flat, spatula-like bill, perfect for filtering small invertebrates and plant matter from the water.
            They are often seen swimming in a line or in coordinated groups, by doing this they stir up food from the bottom, making it easier for those behind to catch drifting particles.<p>
                
            <p> On the <b>right</b> we have the <b>Bufflehead</b> who similarly visits NYC in the winter. 
            Males have a large, white, rounded patch on their head that shines iridescent green and purple in sunlight. 
            Females are mostly brownish-gray with a white cheek patch. Buffleheads are only about 13-16 inches long, making them one of the smallest ducks in NYC. 
            Unlike most ducks that nest on the ground, Buffleheads rely on tree cavities, especially those made by Northern Flicker woodpeckers.<p>
